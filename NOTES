  * Client & Connection
    - Interrupt handler to cancel a bad SELECT * or long SQL. Maybe use dbsetinterrupt
    - Error & Message Handling
      • Test inserting invalid xml in xml data type, timed our for me.
      • Misc code to implement in error handler maybe?
      • Look Into: dbdead
        // if ((dbproc == NULL) || (dbdead(dbproc)))
        //   return INT_EXIT;
      • If you have installed a server message handler, you may want to write your DB-Library error handler so 
        as to suppress the printing of any SYBESMSG error, to avoid notifying the user about the same error twice.

  * Result Set
    - Multiple Result Sets
    - Error & Message Handling
      • Look Into Timeouts
        - dbsettime - Set the number of seconds that DB-Library will wait for a server response to a SQL 
          command. (int seconds) Set a connect_timeout= method like Mysql2 gem, hook into initial connect too.
      • TSQL 'print' and 'raiserror' commands generate server messages that dbmsghandle will catch. (test)
      • See the dbsetuserdata reference page for an example of how to handle deadlock in this way.
    - Test large data set in wchars
    - See if wchar max is only supported in newer FreeTDS
